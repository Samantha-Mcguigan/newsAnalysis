        <p>Welcome to the News Analysis Project. Our goal as a project team is to analyze the
            difference between four major news sources; <b>FOX News</b>, <b>CNN</b>, <b>BBC</b>, and
                <b>NPR</b>. By doing this, we will be looking into how each of these sources
            describe the results from election night.</p>
