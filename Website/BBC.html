            <p>The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is both the world's oldest and largest
                national broadcasting. Many of the standards for news and entertainment broadcasting
                can be traced back to their early involvement as media pioneers. The BBC is
                stationed in London, England but still has a wide reach with its television and
                radio programing.</p>
