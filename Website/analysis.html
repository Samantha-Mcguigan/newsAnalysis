            <p>This bar graph shows the relationship each article group has with each other. We were
                trying to see which gender got quoted more often with the news articles and we think
                we came up with a valid conclusion. Males have been quoted more often, 5 out of the
                6 article groups we looked at, than women, 1 out of the 6 article groups. The only
                article group that had women out quoted the men was the Women's March articles which
                is no surprise there. We are planning on making changes and adding new graphs to
                compare the different news stations and how they used gender in their articles.</p>
