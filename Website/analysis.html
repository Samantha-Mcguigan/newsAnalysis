            <p>This bar graph shows the relationship each article group has with each other. We were
                trying to see which gender got quoted more often with the news articles and we think
                we came up with a valid conclusion. Males have been quoted more often, 5 out of the
                6 article groups we looked at, than women, 1 out of the 6 article groups. The only
                article group that had women out quoted the men was the Women's March articles which
                is no surprise there. There were a total of 238 total quotes that were used
                throughout all the articles that we looked at. 168 of those were said by men, 47
                were said by female, and 23 were said by groups of people. 71% of the articles were
                made up of quotes develped by men while only about 20% of the articles were made up
                of female quotes. There were a total of 29 quotes inside the election results
                articles; 28 were male and 1 was female. In the syrian bombing articles, there was a
                total of 93 quotes; 74 being male, 2 being female, and 17 being groups of people. In
                the articles about the travel ban, there was a total of 47 quotes; 40 being male, 6
                being female, and 1 being a group of people. In the articles about Trump's taxes,
                there were only 19 total quotes used; 14 being male, 0 were female, and 5 were by
                groups of people. The last group of articles we looked at were about the women's
                march. There were a total of 50 quotes used; 12 being men and 38 being women. </p>

            <p>This bar graph shows the relationship each news source has with each other in terms
                of using gender in quotes. We were trying to see which gender got quoted more often
                with the news stations and we think we came up with a valid conclusion. Males have
                been quoted more often overall between all four news sources. BBC had a total of 58
                quotes in the five articles we looked at. 31 of them were male and 11 of them were
                female and the rest, 16, were a group of people. CNN had a total of 77 quotes in the
                articles with 59 of them being male, 13 of them being female, and 5 of them being
                groups of people. Next we have FOX. FOX had a total of 57 quotes (very similar to
                BBC); 45 of them being male, 11 of them being female, and only 1 being a group of
                people. The final station we covered was NPR. They had 46 total quotes in their
                selected articles. 33 of those quotes were given by men, 12 were given by female,
                and 11 were given by groups of people.</p>
