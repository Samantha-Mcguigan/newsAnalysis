            <p>Welcome to the News Analysis Project. Our goal as a project team is to analyze the
                differences between four major news sources by looking at the emotionally charged
                language of the written text and by looking the types people quoted within their
                articles. We chose four of the most popular and easily web accessible news
                organizations based on their political leans and perspectives:</p>
            <br />
            <ul>
                <li>CNN (Cable News Network) - Higher democratic/left lean.</li>
                <li>FOX (Fox News) - Higher republican/right lean.</li>
                <li>BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) - Non-American moderate focus.</li>
                <li>NPR (National Public Radio) - American moderate focus.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Our team specifically selected article topics that would be shared across all four of
                the chosen news outlets. We understood that the articles, though reporting the same
                content, would differ in writing style and tone, which prompted our search for
                descriptive and emotional nouns, verbs, adverbs, and adjectives in the text. Our
                mark-up effort also included a system of “quote assessment” where we gathered loose
                demographic data from the individuals cited within. Our mark up of these individuals
                revolved around their gender and political leanings in attempt to see who is
                represented in the text and see if what was quoted had any connections to the
                language of the articles.</p>
