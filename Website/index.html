            <p>Welcome to the News Analysis Project. Our goal as a project team is to analyze the
                differences between major news sources by looking at the emotionally charged
                language used within the written text. We originally were focused on how the authors
                of these articles chose to use emotive parts of speech (adjectives, nouns, verbs,
                and adverbs) to structure their reports. However, after noticing that quotation
                played a large role in the structure of the articles, we began to document
                demographic data of those quoted in order to design more thorough research
                questions. Our team has been working with articles from these sources listed below,
                chosen for their ease of web-based access and their popularity: </p>
            <br />
            <ul id="sources">
                <li>CNN (Cable News Network) - Higher democratic/left lean.</li>
                <li>FOX (Fox News) - Higher republican/right lean.</li>
                <li>BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) - Non-American moderate focus.</li>
                <li>NPR (National Public Radio) - American moderate focus.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Conclusions</h1>
            <p>Through our analysis of the collected articles, we were able to answer several
                different questions about our sources. We found that FOX and CNN were using the most
                emotional language, which is what we originally assumed we would see. NPR and BBC
                showed considerably less, which we also expected, but we did find that there was
                still a reliance on emotional language. While looking thorough our selected topics,
                originally thought we would see larger instances of bias with the Womanâ€™s March
                articles due to the nature of the protests. However, we found that the articles
                discussing the 2017 election results, exhibited stronger biases. This corresponded
                with the total number of emotional words, with the election articles showing the
                most and the march articles second most. Oddly, the articles on the Travel Ban had
                the least amount of bias where we expected much more. All of our results can be
                viewed via the Analysis page, which you can reach from the drop down on the menu
                bar.</p>
