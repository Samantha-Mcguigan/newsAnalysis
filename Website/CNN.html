            <p>The Cable News Network (CNN) was the first twenty-four hour television news channel
                in the United States. Its creation was an ambitious experiment, but the company grew
                outward and established broadcasting stations across North America, even starting a
                sister group stationed in Canada for international broadcasting. CNN is noted for
                its collection of short documentaries, crime reports, and highly focused interview
                segments produced as “news entertainment”.</p>
