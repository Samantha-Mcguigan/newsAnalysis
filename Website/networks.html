            <p>In this network, the green lines signal a BBC article, the blue lines signal a CNN article, the red lines signal a FOX article and the yellow lines signal                an NPR article. The largest circles contain the different topics of the articles and the lines connect the emotional language words used in the articles                  based on the their topic. The words inside larger circles are used the most throughout the articles and the edge lines connect the words used for more                    than one topic by the source of the article that uses it. The closer the word is to the center of the network the more variety there is in the topics that                use them. The larger the word circle is, the more times it is used overall.</p>
