            <p>This bar graph shows the relationship each news source has with each other in terms
                of using political parties in quotes. We were trying to see what political party
                gets quoted more often within the news sources and what news sources quotes specific
                political parties. For this graph, we were just mainly looking at Republicans and
                Democrats and how often they got quoted. We found some interesting information
                regarding who refrenced what in each news source. BBC had a total of 58 refrences in
                the five articles we looked at. 12 of them were Republican, 13 of them were
                Democrats, and 33 of them were undefined. FOX had a total of 57 references in the
                five articles we looked at. 12 of them were Republican, 13 of them were Democrats,
                and 33 of them were undefined. CNN had a total of 77 refrences in the articles. 40
                of those refrences were Republican, 6 were Democrats, and 31 were undefined. NPR had
                a total of 46 refrences in all the articles. 24 were Republican, 2 were Democrats,
                and 20 were undefined.</p>
