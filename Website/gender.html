            <p>This bar graph compares the relationship each of article group’s gender spread. Males
                have been quoted more often (five out of the six article groups) than women (one out
                of the six article groups). The only article group that had more women quoted than
                men was the Women's March articles, which is understandable due to the content of
                the articles being centered on women. There were 238 total quotes used throughout
                all the articles that we looked at. 168 of those were said by men, 47 were said by
                women, and 23 were said by the group of undetermined attributions. 71% of the
                articles were made up of quotes developed by men while only about 20% of the
                articles were made up of quotes from women. There were a total of 29 quotes inside
                the election results articles; 28 were male and 1 was female. In the Syrian bombing
                articles, there was a total of 93 quotes; 74 being male, 2 being female, and 17
                being from the group of undetermined attributions. In the articles about the travel
                ban, there was a total of 47 quotes; 40 being male, 6 being female, and 1 being from
                the group of undetermined attributions. In the articles about Trump's taxes, there
                were only 19 total quotes used; 14 being male, 0 were female, and 5 were from the
                group of undetermined attributions. The last group of articles we looked at was
                about the women's march. There were a total of 50 quotes used; 12 being men and 38
                being women.</p>

                been quoted more often overall between all four news sources. BBC had a total of 58
                quotes within the five article topics chosen. 31 of them were male, 11 of them were
                female, and 16 came from mixed groups. CNN had a total of 77 quotes in the articles
