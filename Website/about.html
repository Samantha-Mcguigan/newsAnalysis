            <p>What news station do you listen to? How bias is the information you're hearing? Those
                are all the questions that were running through the head of each member of this
                team. Thus, the News Analysis Project was born. They wanted to mainly look at how
                the four selected news sources, FOX, CNN, NPR, and BBC, and see how they each use
                language to describe the similar events. They also wanted to look at how the news
                stations used other sources, such as quotes, to portray each individual event as
                well.</p>
            <p>They decided to look at five different categories; the election results, travel ban,
                women's march, Trump's taxes, and the syrian bombings. They wanted to work with
                articles that were political but also different in the information that was stored
                in the text. They gathered 4 similar articles from each news source and from each
                category, that were around the same time period, inorder to compare and contrast the
                language that was used.</p>
            <p>In order for the team to capture this information, they had to first develop a simple
                mark up that was used in each text file. They were looking for marking up all the
                site information, which includes the author, article title, date, ect., as well as
                the main text that was used in the article. Inside that main text, they were specifically marking up the emotional language </p>
