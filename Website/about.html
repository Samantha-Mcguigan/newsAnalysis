            <p>What news outlets do you use? Do you ever notice potential biases in their content?
                The question of news media bias has always been a matter of debate. We have to ask
                ourselves what is considered acceptable when it involves the need to respect real
                word events while also being honest in reporting. In an internet age where opinions
                and ideas can be near violently debated, it is important to step back and study the
                things we consume in our media diets. The old phrase, “you are what you eat” plays
                into the idea that the media we consume should be “healthy” and we should at least
                properly understand what it is we take in on a daily basis.</p>
            <p>Our project team was spurred on by the now infamous “Alternative Facts” quip taken
                from Kellyanne Conway’s CNN interview. It was like a bad punchline to all the
                accusations of “fake news” and instances of journalistic integrity coming into
                question within the early days of this Trump administration. We came together to
                think brainstorm where we would have to look to easily find patterns of bias in news
                content, and we settled on the aspects of delivery through language.</p>
            <p>The News Analysis Project was developed in order to look deeper into these language
                patterns and discover what information we could gain. We wanted to start with a
                small sample size of news sources, so we settled for four of the more commonly known
                outlets: FOX, CNN, NPR, and BBC. This way we could take a single news topic and then
                find four separate viewpoints (one for each news source) to compare.</p>
            <p>We understood that the articles, though reporting the same content, would differ in
                writing style and tone, which prompted our search for descriptive and emotional
                nouns, verbs, adverbs, and adjectives in the text. Our mark-up effort also included
                a system of “quote assessment” where we gathered loose demographic data from the
                individuals cited within. Our mark up of these individuals revolved around their
                gender and political leanings in attempt to see who is represented in the text and
                see if what was quoted had any connections to the language of the articles.</p>
            <p>We selected five different political topics; the 2017 election results, Trump’s
                travel ban, Women's March, questions regarding Trump's taxes, and the US bombing of
                the Syrian regime. Each topic involved a different cultural concern that would call
                upon various buzzwords like war, gender, etc. that we could focus our studies
                around.</p>
            <p>In order for the team to capture this information, we used Extensible Markup Language
                or XML code to develop copies of the articles inside of text files so we could
                generate method for later referencing. We gathered surface level article data
                (author, article title, date, links, etc.), as well as the entirety of article text
                before taking steps to tag the emotional language. Each team member developed their
                perception of what “emotional” constituted, then coming together we shared our
                perceptions settling for words that were either descriptive or pointed (via
                punctuation, formatted emphasizes, and placement in the sentence) in their usage.
                After marking all of the language, we took to finding quoted individuals and
                assigning them categorical traits based of political and gender demographics. With
                the markup complete, we then developed a variety of comparisons with different
                coding techniques to build visualizations for our findings. </p>
