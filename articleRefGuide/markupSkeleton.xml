<!--JMH: This should be a model for how we should mark up the articles. Check the
    folder for immages files that will help you find the specific information
    required from the different site displays. Feel free to let me know if there
    are changes we should make to this code. Use the numbers as referance, entries
    will also be case sensitive, leave elements empty if their is no data to place
    inside them.
    
    1. This @ref should be a three letter referance to define which outlet the
    article is from: CNN, NPR, FOX, BBC.
    
    2. Copy paste this directly into this as text, we can do a trasformation later.
    
    3. This will differ per site, it is usually a clickable link to other related
    articles under that "type" listed.
    
    4. Self explanitory, we should discuss how we wish to mark the language in the title.
    
    5. Self explanitory, on every page, format this as YYYY,MM,DD
    
    6. Note: This will not appear on every site. If it can be found as if you are a
    regular reader, then include it, we do not need to dig for it.
    
    7. This is the author and editor credits, we can nest these in thier own elements.
    Note that the <author> and/or <editor> names might be located at the bottom of
    the page.
    
    8. Here is where we will put the big blob of text. There are some important things to
    note here: 
    - The text has noticable paragraph breaks, nest each break with a <p> tag.
    - Quotations should be put in <quote> elements to remove the sudo-markup. 
    - Any text that acts as a link should be wrapped in an <a> element, include an
    @href="" attribute and put the link adress inside the quotation marks.
    - Where there is bolded/italics/underlined/strikethrough text nest it in a <em> tag.
    - Indicate where images or videos sit inside the text with a self closing <media/>
    tag, should we decide to do something with them later on, we will know to fill them
    in with more data. EXCLUDE photos/videos not inline with the text. INCLUDE any
    titles/comments below the photo/video in its own <p> tiny tag, we can do a transform
    on those later.
    - Be sure to read over the article and mark the word types we are looking for. These
    would be adverbs <adv>, verbs <ver>, and adjectives <jec>. They are named this way to
    avoid portental mistakes.
    
    9. Note: These will not appear on every site. If they can be found as if you are a
    regular reader (usually at the bottom), then include it, we do not need to dig
    for these.
