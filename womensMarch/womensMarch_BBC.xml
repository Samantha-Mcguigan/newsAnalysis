            <em>Millions of protesters have taken to the streets of cities in the US and around the
                globe to rally against the new US President Donald Trump.</em>
        </p>
        <p>Larger numbers of demonstrators than expected turned out for more than 600 rallies
            worldwide.</p>
        <p>The aim was principally to highlight women's rights, which activists believe to be under
            threat from the new administration.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Mr Trump used his first full day in office to visit the CIA's HQ.</p>
        <p>He said he was <q>1,000%</q> behind the spy agency's employees and <em><a
                    href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38707722">also accused the media
                    of being dishonest in its reporting of the size of the crowd at his
                    inauguration.</a></em></p>
        <p>Mr Trump did not refer to Saturday's protests.</p>
        <p>
            <subHead>'We are the majority'</subHead>
        </p>
        <p>The biggest US rally was in the capital Washington, which city officials estimated to be
            more than 500,000-strong.</p>
        <p>This far exceeded the 200,000 that had originally been expected by organisers of the
            Women's March on Washington.</p>
        <p>By most estimates, it also surpassed the crowd at Friday's presidential inauguration.</p>
        <p>The protesters in the nation's capital heard speeches from Scarlett Johansson, Ugly Betty
            star America Ferrera, Ashley Judd, Gloria Steinem and Michael Moore among others.</p>
        <p>A planned march to the White House proved impossible as the entire route was filled with
            demonstrators.</p>
        <p>Interim DC Police Chief Peter Newsham told Associated Press: <quote>The crowd stretches
                so far that there's no room left to march.</quote></p>
        <p>

        <p>During his speech, Michael Moore ripped up a copy of the Washington Post, saying:
                <quote>The headline was 'Trump takes power'. I don't think so. Here's the power.
                Here's the majority of America right here. We are the majority.</quote></p>
        <media/>
        <p>The singer Madonna also made an appearance, swearing several times in a speech carried
            live by major US TV networks.</p>
        <p><quote>Yes, I am outraged. Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White
                House,</quote> she said.</p>
        <p>America Ferrera told the crowd: <quote>We march today for the moral core of this nation,
                against which our new president is waging a war.</quote></p>
        <p>Huge crowds were reported at other US protests.</p>
        <p>So many turned out in Chicago - some 150,000 - that a planned march had to be called off
            and the event declared a rally. Streets were also overflowing in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Huge crowds were also reported in New York, Seattle, Boston and Miami, some of the venues
            for about 300 nationwide protests.</p>
        <p>Many women wore knitted pink <q>pussy hats</q> - a reference to a recording that emerged
            during the election campaign in which Mr Trump talked about groping women.</p>
        
            <subHead>'These are global problems'</subHead>

        <p>Organisers of a London rally <em><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38700123">said
                    between 80,000 and 100,000 people</a></em> had taken part there. Belfast,
            Cardiff, Edinburgh, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester and Bristol were among the other UK
            cities holding protests.</p>
        <p>Anti-Trump marches took place earlier in Australia, New Zealand and in several Asian
            cities.</p>
        <media/>
        <p>Several thousand women and men joined a rally in central Sydney, with a similar number in
            Melbourne.</p>
        <p>Women's March Sydney co-founder Mindy Freiband told the crowd: <quote>Hatred, hate
                speech, bigotry, discrimination, prejudicial policies - these are not American
                problems, these are global problems.</quote></p>
        <p>Barcelona, Rome, Amsterdam, Geneva, Budapest, Prague and Berlin were among the European
            cities that took part.</p>
        <p>In Paris, protester Francoise Seme Wallon said Mr Trump was <quote>a nasty guy and he's
                dangerous for the whole world</quote>.</p>

        <p>Mr Trump's first full day in office began with an inter-faith service at Washington
            National Cathedral.</p>
        <p>He then visited the CIA's HQ in Langley, Virginia.</p>
        <p>In a speech there, he told about 400 employees: <quote>There is nobody who feels stronger
                about the intelligence community and the CIA than me.</quote></p>
        <p>During the election campaign, Mr Trump had sharply criticised the intelligence agencies
            over their stance on alleged Russian involvement.</p>
        <p>Mr Trump also talked up his yet-to-be-confirmed nominee for CIA chief, Mike Pompeo.</p>
        <p><quote>You will be getting a total gem,</quote> he told the employees.</p>
        <p>In one of his first steps, Mr Trump ordered government agencies to ease the <q>economic
                burden</q> of the health law known as Obamacare.</p>
        <p>His team also quickly overhauled the <em><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/">White
                    House website</a></em>. The revamp replaces Barack Obama's policies with Mr
            Trump's new agenda.</p>
        <p>The new administration lists only six issues on the website - energy, foreign policy,
            jobs and growth, military, law enforcement and trade deals.</p>
        <p>Critics complained that it made no mention of civil rights, healthcare, climate change or
            LGBT rights.</p>
